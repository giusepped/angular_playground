# Angular playground

In this repo, I just play around with angularJS and testing in order to learn more about it.

- In this project, I used Yeoman in order to setup the scaffolding of the application (in previous projects, I set it up manually)

# sw-front

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
